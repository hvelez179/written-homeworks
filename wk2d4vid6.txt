In App Billing v3 (Google I/O 2013)

Bruno Oliviera

The old issues with v2:

-if the app is sleeping a different component has to handle the package


The new way
-billing is synchronous, the model works with google play for quick responses
-google play keeps local cache and makes it less expensive
-to check a users purchases, use getPurchases method
-v3 manages all items and google play handles that, getBuyIntent
-the two above is to avoid losing a purchase
-Cunsumption APIs, make things go away after use
-when to consume? 
	-consume it when it is actually used
	-immediately upon purchase, also on start up
-Subcriptions, first ensure they are allowed, then launch the purchase flow for that
	:when getPurchases is called, subcriptions come up too
-careuful with teh UI thread, if blocked, user will get message not responding error to stop app or wait
	safe: isBillingSupported, getBuyIntent
	not safe: getPurchases, consumePurchase, getSkuDetails

Security
-Risk model, audience, likelyhood, item value, technical dificulty, total purchases, etc
 	:helps you decide how much security to use
-Defenses
	:developer payload, a tag that is attached to the purchase to the buyer
	:signature verification, your app has a public key, google play signs purchase, always check signature
	:Server side verification, secure the server side as well, not just the client side, and make sure the handshake is verified

Sandbox
	-mimicking a purchase for testing purposes in order to ensure it is secure
