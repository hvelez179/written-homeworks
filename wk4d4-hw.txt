What is DDL
	Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands that define the different structures in a database. 
	DDL statements create, modify, and remove database objects such as tables, indexes, and users.

What is DML?
	 data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used 
	 for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes 
	 also considered a component of DML.

The types of JOIN statements and their difference
	1. JOIN or INNER JOIN :
		In this kind of a JOIN, we get all records that match the condition in both the tables, and records in both the tables 
		that do not match are not reported.

	2. OUTER JOIN :
		OUTER JOIN retrieves either, the matched rows from one table and all rows in the other table Or, all rows in all tables 

	There are three kinds of Outer Join :

	2.1 LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN
		This join returns all the rows from the left table in conjunction with the matching rows from the right table. 
		If there are no columns matching in the right table, it returns NULL values.

	2.2 RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN
		This JOIN returns all the rows from the right table in conjunction with the matching rows from the left table. 
		If there are no columns matching in the left table, it returns NULL values.

	2.3 FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN
		This JOIN combines LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. It returns row from either table when the conditions are met 
		and returns NULL value when there is no match.
	
	3. NATURAL JOIN :
		The JOIN is made on all the columns with the same name for equality. Removes duplicate columns from the result.

	4. CROSS JOIN :
		It is the Cartesian product of the two tables involved. The result of a CROSS JOIN will not make sense in most of the situations. 

	5. SELF JOIN :
	It is not a different form of JOIN, rather it is a JOIN (INNER, OUTER, etc) of a table to itself.


WHERE clause
	WHERE clauses are not mandatory clauses of SQL DML statements, but can be used to limit the number of rows affected by a SQL DML statement 
	or returned by a query. In brief SQL WHERE clause is used to extract only those results from a SQL statement, such as: 
	SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

LIKE clause
	The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. There are two wildcards used in conjunction with 
	the LIKE operator:

	% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
	_ - The underscore represents a single character
	
	The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

	LIKE Syntax
	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	ROM table_name
	WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
