The threee categories of Android development that I mostly relate to are: (In the listed order)


1. Transportation - I like this one the best because of my love of travel. As a traveling consumer, I have several airline apps that I use as well as booking
		    apps for flights and vacation resort hotels. I would love to be involved in these types of apps and this industry.


2. eCommerce -  This one I like a lot because of my vast work experience in the retail industry. I am very knowledgeable with retail business models. 
	        I am also a big eCommerce consumer so I have a good idea of how a shopping application is supposed to work. 

 

3. Food - I chose this one as my last preference because the other options do not interest me in the least bit.
