Julie Aranda
	Research, began in 2015, they went to NY & NJ, focused on Attention Management
	-Methodology: interview, observations, group discussions, data synthesis
	-people dont wana miss something, but most notifications are not important
	-user coping stragies, put the phone away, keep the divice quiet, block notifications, do nothing and be annoyed
	-people have deleted apps due to too many notifications
	-only two types people love, messeges from other people, VIP people, and reminders
	-have also been to San Francisco, Portland, Vegas, Chicago, Houston, singapore, china

	Channels, get some notices but not all from an app
	-difine a channel for notification app and the user can make a decision
	-categorize the notifications into groups
	-touch and hold the notification to turn off a channel
	Behavior Model
	-Some people put up with it to not mess with settings
	-current model has priority per notification
	-new model has importance level for channels and less customization
	-trading flexibility for simplicity
	-set a notification per importance level

	Visual Hierarchy
	-Different buckets : Major Ongoing, People to people, General, By the way	
	-UI groups them together by importance
	-Major Ongoing: time sensitive stuff, calls, directions, timer, etc
		-appear right at the top, integrate the artwork 	
	-People to people: messages, etc
		-expose more lines of content (3 lines)
		-direct reply coming soon
	-General: timed reminders
	-By the way: took notices from general that are not so urgent
		-weather updates, suggestions, promotions
		-simplified the presentation to make it more light weight
		-automatically expire and dissappear by themselves
		-nice looking drawer for notifications with cool animation
		-snoozing: allow user to snooze a notification
